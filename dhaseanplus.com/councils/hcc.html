<p>In the latest instalment of the much-loved Historical Crisis Committee (HCC), 
delegates will traverse time and find themselves at the outset of the Battle for
Malaya during WWII. Delegates will be conferred the roles of prominent officials
within the British military and civilian government, and they will face the 
formidable challenge of repelling the impending Japanese invasion. Much will be 
at stake, for the island of Singapore – located at the tip of the Malayan peninsula
– was a major British military base and a cornerstone of British imperial 
defence. Delegates will experience the thrill of engaging in combat amidst 
dealing with pressing economic and social issues. Delegates must challenge 
themselves to act swiftly, decisively and effectively, for the security of 
Malaya lies in their hands.</p>

<p>Tze (pronounced “Zi”) Zhao is a JC1 student taking the rarely spotted subject combination of Physics, Computing, Math and History. Despite being having the stereotypical nerdy traits of a science student, his strong interest in the humanities has led him to join the MUN circuit. He spends whatever free time he has juggling between reading wikipedia pages, studying memes, and digesting any other random information he can get his itchy hands on. He hopes that council will find this MUN fruitful and wishes the council all the best.</p>

With crisis experience as a delegate in both local and overseas conferences, Adam will step up to be part of the team that runs the most advanced council in MUN. Whether you are trying crisis for the first time or a seasoned crisis delegate, he hopes that you will have a meaningful and enjoyable learning experience here at DHAP HCC - just as he has.</p>

<p>Nicholas is a Year 6 student who, like every other student in his cohort, is suffering from the shackles of the A levels. Nicknamed “Winnie the Pooh” by his Economics tutor, he as admitted that he shares many uncanny similarities with it (including looks). Like how Pooh made his last appearance in the Christopher Robin movie, DHAP 2019 would be Nicholas’ swan song. In school, he is usually seen struggling to stay awake during lectures as well as attempting to cope with his infinite number of commitments! He is aware that MUN is more often than not a very nerve-wracking experience, but believes that there is still much to gain from it. He looks forward to seeing delegates have a fruitful and enjoyable time during council. He assures all that HCC will be one that will go down in history as a crisis simulation like no other. :’)</p>

<p>Otherwise known as the guy whose eyes cannot be seen when he smiles, Ryan enjoys eating and sleeping and awaits the day he will be free of all work so that he can catch up on his sleep. During his free time, he is often found scrolling through his news resource that resembles nothing but a Twitter, due to his interest in global affairs, or Youtube where he finds mashups to listen to! He also looks forward to seeing the council have a fruitful experience together and wishes all delegates the best!</p>
