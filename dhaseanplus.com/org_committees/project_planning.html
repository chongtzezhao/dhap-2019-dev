They promise to make delegates’ DHAP experience one worth remembering beyond council sessions with the various ceremonies!</p>

<p>They look forward to meeting delegates at DHAP 2019 and hope that delegates will have a fulfilling and fun time.</p>

<p>Cherylynn is a Year 6 student at Dunman High School. Despite being in Project Planning,  Cherylynn (ironically) has problems with planning her time and projects. At the time of writing, Cherylynn has a few tests to study for, a dozen of emails to send out and tons of overdue work to clear. As such, Cherylynn cannot afford to spend too much time on this biography. In short, Cherylynn hopes that everyone will PRESS on and she looks forward to seeing everyone in a desirable state at DHAP 2019!</p>

<p>Elieen is someone with many faces. She may look angry at first glance, but it’s only because she hasn’t gotten her daily caffeine dosage. Don’t hesitate to say hi to her because chances are, she isn’t mad at you.</p>

                    <h3 id="assistant-executive-director">Assistant Executive Director</h3>

<p>Vanessa is a little monkey girl who likes to run and screech and jump and scream all day, everyday. Despite recently having suffered a ligament tear - due to playing again, of course - she has continued to live her reckless lifestyle. She cannot and will not be stopped. To spot her at DHAP 2019, look out for someone who can be heard way before she can be seen! To add on, she aspires to live in a farm with 10 dogs and a few cows - animals which will bring her maximum utility. Support Vanessa by joining DHAP and in stopping dog meat trade. She hopes that all delegates will have an enjoyable DHAP, particularly the socials she planned for them.</p>

<p>Chelsea has tons of stuff to do in her life and loves being overly ambitious (as seen by her decision to join 3 different CCAs). She does this while hoping to not fail her exams at the end of the year. She laughs like crazy at times but do not be afraid to approach her, for she is actually very nice and friendly!</p>
